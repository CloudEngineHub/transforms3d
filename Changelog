Releases
********

MB below means Matthew Brett.  Generally MB made changes not otherwise
attributed.

* 0.4.1 (Thursday 1st September 2022)

  Bugfix release.

  * Specify that this release requires Python 3.6 and above.  MB accidentally
    broke some installs by upgrading Versioneer, and forgetting to test with
    Python 2.7.  Versioneer has not supported Python 2.7 for several years.

* 0.4 (Saturday 27th August 2022)

  New feature release, bugfixes, updates.

  * Improved inverse shear implementation (Jos√© Luis Esteban).
  * Adding powers of quaternion functions ``qexp`` and ``qlog``, ``qpow``
    (Maxime Lemonnier).
  * Fix in-place modification of arrays in ``euler2quat`` (Jiayuan-Gu).
  * Allow for not-normalized quaternions for ``rotate_vector`` (thanks to
    Zhichao Li for pointing out the problem).
  * Various maintenance improvements - move to Pytest, update Versioneer to
    latest (Hugo van Kemenade), always use Setuptools, start using Github
    workflow, documentation fixes (Filip Sund), fix older ``np.float`` usage
    to resolve Numpy deprecation warnings.

* 0.3.1 (Friday 16th June 2017)

  * Add various modules to top-level init (issue gh-13).

* 0.3 (Wednesday 3rd August 2016)

  * Change in calculation of quaternion to axis-angle; quaternions now not
    assumed normalized - input quaternions normalized to unit quaternions on
    input.  This may give you different results from the previous calculation;
  * Fix for warning running NumPy 1.11;
  * DOC updates and refactoring.

* 0.2.1

  * Fixes to setup.py and MANIFEST file for correct installation;

* <= 0.2

  * See ``git log``.
